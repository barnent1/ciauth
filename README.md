CodeIgniter 3.0+ Authorization, Navigation, Template, and DataTables Library

CIAUTH is an authentication, navigation, template, and datatables library for CodeIgniter 3.0+ and PHP 5.5. It is built 
completely from the ground up using the latest PHP security functions and incorporates
all of the new CodeIgniter capabilities including database functions using the
QueryBuilder. 

Installation:

Download the zip file
Copy the the contents of each folder to the corresponding folder. For example move the individual controllers from the controllers folder to your controllers folder. Do the same for libraries, config, views etc..

use the sql script to create the neccessary tables. 

Add a user to the user_accounts table and give it admin privillages. Login to the system and use the navigation builder to build your navigation menus.

Look at the example views and demo controllers to see how it is used. Detailed Documentation is coming soon.
